Introduction to Data Science term project


Donorschoose.org is a public charity that connects the public to public schools in need. Public school teachers seek help by posting projects on the website such as requesting books, technology or other things for educational purposes. People can go on to the website and select a classroom project to support by donating money. After the required amount of donation is reached, Donorschoose then orders the requested goods to the teacher in need.

Our goal is to predict whether a project will fail to achieve its donation goal and to rank projects in the website. With this information in hand, the website will be able to improve its user experience in several aspects and boost profits.
